{"id": "passage_1", "text": "Data quality validation is crucial in ETL pipelines. Schema drift occurs when the structure of incoming data changes unexpectedly, such as new columns being added, existing columns being removed, or data types changing. To detect schema drift, you can implement automated schema comparison between expected and actual data schemas. Tools like Great Expectations, Apache Griffin, or custom validation scripts can monitor for schema changes and alert teams when drift is detected. Best practices include maintaining a schema registry, implementing gradual schema evolution, and having rollback procedures when incompatible changes are detected."}
{"id": "passage_2", "text": "ETL pipeline monitoring requires comprehensive observability across data ingestion, transformation, and loading phases. Key metrics to track include data freshness (how recent the data is), data volume (number of records processed), data quality scores (completeness, accuracy, consistency), and pipeline performance (execution time, resource usage). Monitoring tools should provide real-time alerts for anomalies, trend analysis for capacity planning, and detailed logs for debugging. Popular solutions include Apache Airflow for orchestration monitoring, Datadog or Prometheus for infrastructure metrics, and custom dashboards for business-specific KPIs."}
{"id": "passage_3", "text": "Data lineage tracking is essential for understanding data flow through complex systems. It helps teams identify upstream dependencies, assess impact of changes, and debug data quality issues. Data lineage should capture source systems, transformation logic, intermediate datasets, and final destinations. Modern data catalogs like Apache Atlas, DataHub, or Amundsen provide automated lineage discovery through query parsing and metadata collection. Manual annotation is also important for business context that automated tools might miss. Lineage visualization helps stakeholders understand data provenance and supports compliance requirements like GDPR right-to-explanation."}
