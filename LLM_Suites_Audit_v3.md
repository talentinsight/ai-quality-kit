# LLM Suites Audit v3 - AI Quality Kit Framework

**Audit Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Framework Version:** Commit `b717b8a5`  
**Auditor:** AI Quality Kit Static Analysis  
**Scope:** Complete test suite readiness assessment for arbitrary LLM evaluation

---

## Executive Summary

The AI Quality Kit framework demonstrates **strong foundational architecture** for LLM testing with comprehensive Red Team, Safety, Bias, Performance, and RAG evaluation capabilities. The system is **production-ready in core areas** with sophisticated orchestration, fail-fast gating, and multi-format reporting. However, **coverage gaps exist** in advanced performance testing (throughput/stress), embedding robustness implementation, and test coverage (12% vs 80% target). The framework excels in security-first design with PII masking, three-point safety moderation, and statistical bias detection with confidence intervals.

**Overall Readiness Score: 7.2/10** (Production-Ready with Gaps)
