# AI Quality Kit - Project Status Report

## Project Snapshot

**AI Quality Kit** is a comprehensive testing framework for evaluating the quality, reliability, and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). This production-ready tool enables organizations to implement automated quality assurance for AI applications through structured evaluation pipelines.

The project represents a novel approach to AI testing where artificial intelligence is used to systematically evaluate other AI systems. It provides automated test case generation, multi-provider LLM evaluation, and standardized reporting mechanisms that ensure AI applications meet quality thresholds before deployment.

**Core Value Proposition**: AI Quality Kit acts as a CI/CD quality gate for AI systems, preventing unreliable or unsafe models from reaching production environments.

   ```

4. **First Demo Execution**
   ```bash
   # Start the RAG service
   uvicorn apps.rag_service.main:app --reload --port 8000
   
   # Run quality tests
   pytest -q
   
   # Test API endpoint
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "How to validate schema drift?"}'
   ```

## Usage Flow

### Test Execution Pipeline

1. **Test Case Definition**
   - Golden dataset creation with question-answer pairs
   - Context passage preparation for retrieval testing
   - Safety attack prompt compilation

2. **Automated Evaluation Process**
   - RAG pipeline execution with FAISS-based retrieval
   - Multi-dimensional quality assessment using Ragas metrics
   - JSON schema validation for structured outputs
   - Safety testing against adversarial inputs

3. **Results Analysis**
   - Threshold-based pass/fail determination
   - Detailed scoring across quality dimensions
   - Comprehensive error reporting and debugging information
   - Actionable recommendations for improvement

### Example Workflow
```python
# 1. Initialize RAG pipeline
rag_pipeline = RAGPipeline(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", top_k=4)

# 2. Execute query
result = rag_pipeline.query("What are data quality best practices?")

# 3. Evaluate response
scores = eval_batch([{
    'question': query,
    'answer': result['answer'],
    'contexts': result['context'],
    'ground_truth': expected_answer
}])

# 4. Validate against thresholds
assert scores['faithfulness'] >= 0.75
assert scores['context_recall'] >= 0.80
```
