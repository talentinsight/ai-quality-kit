# AI Quality Kit — Project Status Report (V4)

**Date (UTC):** 2024-08-22 15:30 UTC  
**Scope:** Read-only audit; authoritative coverage; security posture; cold/warm latency (best-effort)  
**Note:** This report supersedes prior conflicting figures. Coverage herein is the single source of truth.

## 1) Repository & Runtime Snapshot

- **Python runtime:** 3.13.0 (virtual environment)
- **Key modules present:** 
  - `apps/rag_service/main.py` ✔
  - `llm/provider.py` ✔
  - `apps/cache/cache_store.py` ✔
  - `apps/observability/log_service.py` ✔
  - `apps/security/` ✖ (not present)
- **Dependencies detected:** pytest, pytest-cov, httpx, orjson ✔ (7/7 found in requirements.txt)

## 2) Single-Source Coverage (Authoritative)

- **Command:** `pytest --cov=apps --cov=llm --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html --ignore=evals --ignore=guardrails --ignore=safety`
- **Result:** **Total coverage = 78%**
- **HTML report generated at:** `htmlcov/index.html`
- **Test execution:** 133 tests passed, 25 warnings, 200.76s execution time
- **Coverage breakdown:**
  - High coverage (≥85%): config.py (100%), rag_pipeline.py (99%), hash_utils.py (100%), prompts.py (100%), eval_logger.py (89%), snowflake_client.py (88%), log_service.py (92%), provider.py (98%), json_utils.py (96%)
  - Medium coverage (60-84%): cache_store.py (68%), run_context.py (67%), neg_utils.py (81%)
  - Low coverage (<60%): live_eval.py (25%)

## 3) Security Posture (Auth/RBAC/Audit/Encryption)

| Capability | Code Present | Flag in .env.example | Status | Note |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|------|
| Auth       | ✖ | Not found | GAP | No authentication system implemented |
| RBAC       | ✖ | Not found | GAP | No role-based access control |
| Audit Log  | ✖ | Not found | GAP | Basic logging present but no audit trail |
| Encryption | ✖ | Not found | GAP | No at-rest encryption configuration |

**Security Gaps Identified:**
- No authentication middleware in FastAPI application
- No authorization checks on API endpoints
- No audit logging for security events
- No encryption keys for sensitive data storage

## 4) Performance: Cold vs Warm (Best-Effort)

- **Server start:** OK (already running on port 8000)
- **Request:** `POST /ask` with body `{"query":"How to validate schema drift?"}`
- **Results:**
  - **Cold latency:** 11.76s, HTTP: 200, Size: 3030 bytes
  - **Warm latency:** 2.92s, HTTP: 200, Size: 3030 bytes
  - **Performance improvement:** 75% faster on warm call (cache hit)
- **Headers:** No performance-specific headers (X-Source, X-Perf-Phase) detected
- **Note:** Only two samples measured; indicative of cache effectiveness but not statistically significant for p95 targets

## 5) Caching & Observability Signals (Static)

- **Cache module present:** ✔ (`apps/cache/cache_store.py`)
- **Cache flags:** CACHE_ENABLED, CACHE_TTL_SECONDS, CONTEXT_VERSION (3/3 found in .env.example)
- **Logging/Eval modules:** 
  - `log_service.py` ✔
  - `live_eval.py` ✔ (low coverage: 25%)
- **Snowflake client present:** ✔ (`apps/db/snowflake_client.py`)
- **No secrets printed; no DB queries executed**

## 6) Consistency Resolution

- **Previous conflicting coverage figures:** 
  - V3 report mentioned 77% coverage
  - V4 measurement shows 78% coverage
- **This V4 figure is authoritative:** 78%
- **Coverage increase:** +1% from previous measurement
- **All prior coverage numbers are superseded by this V4 measurement**

## 7) Production Gate Readiness (Go/No-Go)

- **SECURITY (Auth+RBAC+Audit):** FAIL - No authentication, authorization, or audit logging implemented
- **COVERAGE (≥ 80%):** FAIL (current = 78%, target = 80%)
- **PERFORMANCE (warm p95 target):** INDICATIVE ONLY - Only two samples measured, cache shows 75% improvement
- **RUNTIME (Python 3.11.x pinned):** FAIL - Running on Python 3.13.0, no version pinning
- **OBSERVABILITY (cold/warm visibility + alerts documented):** PARTIAL - Basic logging present, no performance headers or alert queries

**Decision:** **Not for production** - Security gaps and coverage below threshold require immediate attention before production deployment.

## 8) Action Plan (7–14 days)

### **Week 1: Security & Coverage (Critical)**
- [ ] **Implement basic authentication:** Add FastAPI security dependencies and JWT token validation
- [ ] **Add authorization middleware:** Implement role-based access control for API endpoints
- [ ] **Raise coverage to ≥80%:** Focus on cache_store.py (68%→75%) and live_eval.py (25%→35%)
- [ ] **Add audit logging:** Implement security event logging and user action tracking

### **Week 2: Production Hardening**
- [ ] **Pin Python version:** Create .python-version file and update deployment scripts
- [ ] **Add performance headers:** Implement X-Source and X-Perf-Phase headers for observability
- [ ] **Security review:** Conduct penetration testing and security audit
- [ ] **Documentation:** Create production deployment guide and SLO definitions

### **Immediate Actions (Next 48 hours)**
- [ ] **Security assessment:** Document all security gaps and create remediation timeline
- [ ] **Coverage sprint:** Focus on low-hanging fruit to reach 80% threshold
- [ ] **Environment hardening:** Review and secure all configuration files
